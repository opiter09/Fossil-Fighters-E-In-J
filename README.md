# Fossil-Fighters-E-In-J
This rather unnecessary little repo allowd you to transplant FF1 English text into the Japanese version. It also transplants the fonts, sadly rendering all Japanese player names as blank.

NOTE 1: This requires *two* ROMs, the American one and the Japanese one. They need to be named america.nds and japan.nds, respectively, and *must* be in the same folder as lang.exe.
Once that's prepared, just run lang.exe, wait a bit, and then enjoy your new out.nds!

NOTE 2: There are some bugs and text errors as a result of this, such as seing "SaveHeadCancel" instead of "(Head)" in fossil names, and overly-long map names having their rightmost
pixels stay on the screen. I really don't care to enough to even look into these, though, so just deal with it.

To download this, if you are confused, press the Green "Code" button in the top right, then choose "Download ZIP."
