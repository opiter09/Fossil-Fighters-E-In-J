# Fossil-Fighters-E-In-J
This rather unnecessary little repo allowd you to transplant FF1 English text into the Japanese version. It also transplants the fonts, sadly rendering all Japanese names as blank.

NOTE: This requires *two* ROMs, the American one and the Japanese one. They need to be named america.nds and japan.nds, respectively, and must be in the same folder as start.exe.
Once that's prepared, just run start.exe, wait a bit, and then enjoy your new out.nds!

To download this, if you are confused, press the Green "Code" button in the top right, then choose "Download ZIP."
